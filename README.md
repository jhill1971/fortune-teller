# fortune-teller
A variation of the Magic 8 Ball that returns a response to the user's question and a set of lottery numbers. This project is ready to be "prettified". I'm thinking 
along the lines of late-19th/early 20th century magician poster styling. That being said, the logic all works. I'm also thinking of enclosing the lottery numbers 
in white and red circles.
